# Space Age Machine Tiers

Basically Adds Some Higher Tier Space-Age Machines To Match Bob's Style Progression. Like Quality, But Different!

Adds Tier 2 and 3 versions of many space age machines to the game to try and basically match what many of bobs mods are doing for progression.

I made the changes and stats configurable in the mod settings page.

This is currently in early stages, as I mostly made it for my modded play-through, but I will try to fix bugs or issues that get brought up.
Also, currently only has localization support for English, but would be happy to work with anyone to make a translation for your language.
